This is a program to automate job search across well known platforms like linkedin and indeed. 

For now, an excel file is generated with the results of various jobs obtained from linkedin.com and indeed.ca based on the job title, location and the number of results. In future, this project can be extended to automate job applications for platforms like workday, wherein applying for jobs becomes monotonous since the user has to enter basic information again and again for related jobs (it would be made to ensure no bulk spam applications are sent in). 

Here are some screenshots illustrating the output of the code:
